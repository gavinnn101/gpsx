* Bot management panel
    * Can view stats per bot
        * all time stats
        * session stats
            * session time
            * total earned in session
            * earned per hour in session
    * shutdown bot 
    * start up bot would also be cool but depends on being able to open the executor programatically I think
    * Bots should report their server id to REST API if they find a comet. 
    * * If another bot for a user starts to server hop, it should check if there's a found comet from the API.
    * * If there's no comet available, hop to a random server like normal.
